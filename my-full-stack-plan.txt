My full-stack web development path

- Create simple CRUD using :
    * Laravel (Back-end) 
    * React or Angular (Front-end).
    * Next.js is also quite interesting for Back-end (?)
- Find out how to deploy an application using cPanel or Heroku.
- Create real life projects (as much as I can).
- Express.js!!!
